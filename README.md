# minimac: Minimum Multi-horizon Autocovariances
## The Multi-Horizon Test for Market Frictions

This repository provides software packages in `Matlab`, `Python` and `R` for implementing the statistical test developed in [Multi-Horizon Test for Market Frictions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2025.106171), published in the *Journal of Econometrics*. 

## What the test can do
  - Check whether intraday prices are relatively **free of microstructure noise**.
  - Diagnose whether the underlying return series is **uncorrelated** or exhibits serial dependence.
  - Detect persistent returns driven by large drifts or **drift bursts**.
  - Outperforms modern **variance ratio** and **portmanteau tests**.


The key statistic is defined as

$$ 
H(Y;\mathbf{K}_\ell)^n_t := \min_{k_j \in \mathbf{K}_\ell} H(Y;k_j)^n_t,
$$

where $\mathbf{K}_\ell = \{1,2,\ldots,2^\ell\},\ \ell = 0,1,2,3$ and the standardized single-horizon testing statistic

$$
H(Y;k)_t^n:=\frac{F(Y;k)_t^n}{\sqrt{\Phi_k\:Q(Y)_t^n}}
$$
is derived from
$$
F(Y;k)_t^n:=\frac{1}{2k}\sum_{i=k+1}^{n_t-k}f(Y;k)_i^n,\quad f(Y;k)_i^n:=(Y_i^n-Y_{i-k}^n)(Y_{i+k}^n-Y_i^n),\quad \Phi_k:=\frac16\left(k+\frac1{2k}\right), \quad Q(Y)_t^n:=\sum_{i=2}^{n_t-1}(f(Y;1)_i^n)^2.
$$

## Getting Started

There are 3 folders in the directory:

- In the `./MATLAB` folder,  a function script `minimac.m` that depends on `cvs.mat` table and a test script `test.m` are provided. 
- Similarly, each of `./R` and `./Python` contains a corresponding function script that depends on `cvs.csv` table and a test script/ipynb.
  

## Usage and Examples

- The callable function `stat=minimac(y,T)` employs uniform syntax across mentioned languages, where `y` is **log price** and `T` is **sample period of your dataset** (T=1/252 represents data covers 1 day's trading hours). 

- `summary_minimac(stat)` returns formal output for `stat=minimac(y,T)` testing result (also callable in all mentioned languages). Note that the function is in independent script for MATLAB, while for R and Python, it is integrated in corresponding function script of minimac.

- Before calling `minimac(y,T)`, put function script (e.g., `minimac.m`, `summary_minimac.m`) and critical value table (e.g., `cvs.mat`) into your current directory. 

- MATLAB:

  ```matlab
  % Import data
  data = readtable('../SPY_20141215_1s.csv'); % import your intraday data here
  y = log(data.PRICE);
  
  % Testing for Market Friction
  stat = minimac(y,1/252);
  summary_minimac(stat)
  ```

- R:

  ```R
  # Load function of minimac
  source("minimac.R")
  
  # Import data
  data <- read.csv("../SPY_20141215_1s.csv") # import your data here
  y <- log(data$PRICE)
  
  # Testing for Market Friction
  stat <- minimac(y,1/252)
  summary_minimac(stat)
  
  ```

- Python:

  ```python
  ## Import modules
  from minimac import minimac, summary_minimac
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  
  ## Load data and run minimac
  data = pd.read_csv('../SPY_20141215_1s.csv') # input your data here
  y = np.log(data['PRICE'])
  stat = minimac(y,1/252)
  summary_minimac(stat)
  ```

- All languages will return identical output
